# Master-Thesis

This repository has been created to support my master thesis entitled "Comparing Machine Learning Variable Selection Approaches for Agricultural Prediction in Germany". 
The data analysis of this work includes exploratory analyses such as correlation heatmap, hierarchical cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and prediction modeling by coupling random spatial cross-validation with
machine learning variable selection approaches including ridge, lasso, and random forest recursive feature elimination.
